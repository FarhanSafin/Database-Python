closes the program when the user gives "q" as a input. After giving input the system takes the input and converts it to a string and then save it in a binary file. Afterwards, when it is retrieved the binary file data is first converted to a string and then converted to a list and then displayed to the user.

File Description:

- Reading_Records file is used to retrieve the data from the user and display it.
- Three(3) Libraries available in the library folder.
